#  Similarity Test-Based Estimation of High-Dimensional Means or Kernel Mean Embeddings

Here, you can find the code to recreate the experiments of the paper
> Marienwald, Hannah, Fermanian, Jean-Baptiste and Blanchard, Gilles. (2021). High-Dimensional Multi-Task Averaging and Application to Kernel Mean Embedding. In *International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics*, PMLR.

More specifically, see ...
* ... `KME_estimation` for the experiments that estimate the kernel mean embeddings (Python code). The results were reported in Section 4.1 and 4.2. of the paper.
* ... `MEAN_estimation` for the experiments that estimate high-dimensional means (GNU Octave code). The results were reported in Section 8 of the Supplemental of the paper.
