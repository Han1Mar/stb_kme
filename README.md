Similarity test-based estimation of kernel mean embeddings

Here, you can find the code to recreate the experiments of the paper 
*High-Dimensional Multi-Task Averaging and Application to Kernel Mean Embedding*
which will be presented at AISTATS 2021. 

!This repository is still under construction!

For the experiments on the estimation of multiple means, please go to folder *MEAN_estimation* (GNU Octave code). For the experiments on the estimation of multiple kernel means, please go to folder *KME_estimation* (Python code). Consult the README files in the subdirectories for further instructions.
